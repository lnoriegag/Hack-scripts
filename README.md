# Hacking scripts

This repo contains some scripts can be useful (or maybe not :D) for hacking:

 1. [wifipwds.py](https://github.com/nogag94/some-hacking-scripts/blob/master/wifipwds.py) - This script dumps wifi passwords saved on Windows computer.
 2. [dictionary_attack_POST.py](https://github.com/nogag94/some-hacking-scripts/blob/master/dictionary_attack_POST.py) - This script can be used for dictionary attack against known-users.
 
     **Useful dictionaries can be found here:**
